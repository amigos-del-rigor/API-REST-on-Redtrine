# Feature: Hydrator
#     In order to Object Hydration
#     As a Developer
#     I need to transform serialized objects to real one

#     Scenario: Basic Hydration
#         Given I have a basic serialized object
#         And the Object Class is "TestClass"
#         When I call hydrate
#         Then I get an Object instance of "TestClass"
